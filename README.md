In this case study we have analysed the lending data of a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers, to identify the client attributes and loan attributes which lead to default.

The purpose of the exercise is to use these patterns, which are predictive of default, for taking actions for potential customers who are likely to have payment problems, such as

i. denying the loan to potential customers
ii. reducing the amount of loan,
iii. lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate.

While we attempt to reduce risk of lending to customers who are likely to default, we also try to ensure that good customers do not get rejected.
